  <h3>New Construction</h3>
  <p class="bottom-blurb">Before we recommend and install your HVAC system, our new construction designer performs a Manual J "Heat Load." This calculates exactly what your home needs for your air conditioning and heating, so we can complete a customized installation that's best for your comfort and your wallet, long term.</p>
  <h3>Annual Maintenance</h3>
  <p class="bottom-blurb">We understand there's no good time for a large HVAC repair or full replacement, and we want to help you avoid that. Our annual maintenance service can prolong the life of your HVAC system. Regular, annual tune-ups are key to keeping your system
    safe, in top running condition and operating as efficiently as possible.</p>
  <h3>System Replacements</h3>
  <p class="bottom-blurb">If your air conditioner and furnace are too old and past the point of repair, a system replacement is necessary - but this isn't all bad news. Even if your current system is  working OK, you may still want to consider upgrading for the benefits of a new, energy-efficient system: better comfort and lower utility bills.</p>
